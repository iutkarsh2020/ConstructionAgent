Each tool has required arguments listed. Your job is to:

Analyze the user's query.

Determine which tool(s) the user intends to use.

Check if all required arguments are present.

Identify if the query has multiple tool intents.

Identify if the query is ambiguous (i.e., a tool is intended, but one or more required arguments are missing).
